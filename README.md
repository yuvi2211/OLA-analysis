# OLA-analysis
In this project, I worked with a large dataset of approximately 100,000 records, leveraging SQL and Power BI to extract valuable insights and drive meaningful analysis.

Some key areas I focused on include:
✅ Top 5 High-Value Customers – Identified the most valuable customers based on spending and ride frequency.
✅ Average Customer Rating for Vehicles – Analyzed customer feedback trends to determine top-rated and low-rated vehicle categories.
✅ Ride Cancellation Patterns – Uncovered key factors contributing to ride cancellations, helping in service improvement.
✅ Revenue Trends & Customer Segmentation – Segmented customers based on ride history and spending behavior to enhance business strategies.

By combining SQL for data extraction and transformation with Power BI for visualization, I built a dynamic and interactive dashboard that uncovers patterns, optimizes decision-making, and provides actionable insights.
